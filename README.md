# ProductivityOpen CircuitPython Library Bundle
This repo bundles a bunch of CircuitPython libraries into an easy to download zip file. The included libraries are intended to be used with ProductivityOpen CircuitPython products. Up-to-date bundles can be found on the releases section of this repo. 

ProductivityOpen CPUs are loaded with the libraries included in this bundle before shipping. Because of this, your CPU's libraries may not be up-to-date with the latest versions when you receive it. It is recommended you update them using either bundle releases from this repo, or as needed using a tool like Adafruit's [CircUp](https://github.com/adafruit/circup).

This repo pulls its libraries from the [Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle) repo and the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle).

Bundle releases on this repo go through a hardware test before being published to mitigate breaking changes caused by library updates.
